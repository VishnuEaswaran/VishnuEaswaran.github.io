title: Revamped website!
---

After months of procrastination, today is the day! I have been planning to redo the website for quite a while but the master procrastinator within, pulled me back every single time.

My interest for *engineering, Fab Labs, books, movies, music, politics, linux etc* will probably dominate my posts. Also I would like to link all my present and future works here. I have already linked whatever little I have worked on like Fab Academy, Pre Academy and the related projects. Another important intention is to document my experiences as an instructor for the ongoing Fab academy in Fab Lab Trivandrum.

Previously this address was dedicated for my [Pre Academy](http://vishnueaswaran.github.io/Pre-Academy) documentation which I have shifted completely to another repo and made use of `gh-pages` to host and link(which is in the navigation bar) it to this page.

I might modify this site to have more features and to improve usability in the future. I like this arrangement for the moment and will probably stick on to the same style. I made use of the in built [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) service by [GitHub](https://github.com/). Jekyll is a blog-aware, static site generator in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). After fumbling with default layout and theme, which I didn't like, I looked for more options and found a template called [Basic](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/basic/) by *Micah cowell*. I have adopted it and tweaked a little for making this website. Also I am sharing all these under the [MIT license](https://github.com/VishnuEaswaran/VishnuEaswaran.github.io/blob/master/LICENSE) hoping that making it open could benefit someone-somewhere-someday !

That is the story for now and about to begin the documentation of being an instructor ;)

## Good Day:)
