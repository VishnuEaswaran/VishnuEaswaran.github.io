## Hi there !!

An engineer by profession and a humanist by nature. I currently work as a *Research Associate* in [FOSSE](http://www.sahridhaya.org/), IIT Bombay; the title translates to applied researcher and/or as an Embedded Systems Engineer. Previously I was assosciated with Kerala Startup mission-- initially as a *Technology Innovation Fellow* and later as a *Technology Associate* at their *Fab Labs*.

[*Sahridhaya*](http://www.sahridhaya.org/) is my alter ego, an NGO operating in Kerala where I volunteered from its inception, and recently, I got fortunate enough to be selected into the Board of Trustees.

I want to keep this place clean & simple, and have it as a single place to document my work. Thanks for coming by and I love to have a conversation with you; drop an email to easwaranvishnu[at]gmail.com if interested.

Wish you a Good Day!
